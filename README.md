What is poppin' boys and bois, It's ya boie MANGOMAN here.
By now, you should be aware of the basics of GitHub.

Should you not however, here is some basic information on how to use GitHub:


Repository - The bulk of the operation. This is where we store all our Unity files.

Repositories have BRANCHES. These are essentially different copies of the Unity files.
By default, all changes happen on the MASTER branch. The MASTER branch contains our true game project.

Once you've made any changes to the files (adding, modifying, removing), changes will appear on your GitHub Desktop.

You can add a Summary & Description before COMMITING.

By COMMITING, you save the changes that you've made to the current version of the Unity files.
To send this save data to the MASTER branch, you have to PUSH the changes.

In order to download the most recent version on a branch, you must FETCH from that branch.

FORKING - Should you wish to modify something or try a new mechanic out, you can ADD a NEW BRANCH. All changes on this new branch will not be saved to the MASTER branch.

PULLING - Collaborators that make changes on another branch that wish to save theirchanges to the true game project can submit a PULL REQUEST. Once verified, the files on that branch will MERGE with the MASTER.

There are probably a few things i've missed but that should be the bulk of it.
If you require clarity on a few things you know where to hmu.

BUCKLE UP,

MANGOMAN
